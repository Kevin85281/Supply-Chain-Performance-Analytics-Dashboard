Supply Chain Performance Analytics Dashboard

Tool: Power BI
Domain: Supply Chain and Operations Analytics

Objective
Build an executive level Power BI dashboard to analyze order volume, revenue, profitability, and delivery performance, enabling stakeholders to monitor service levels and identify operational tradeoffs.

Tool & Skills
Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Data Modeling, KPI Design, Interactive Dashboards

Data & Modeling
Order level transactional data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query.
A star schema was implemented with:
FactOrders containing order, revenue, profit, and delivery metrics
DimDate, DimCustomer, and DimProduct as dimension tables

The model uses Order Date as the active relationship to support demand and revenue trend analysis, with Shipping Date retained for future time intelligence.

Key KPIs (DAX Measures)
Total Orders
Total Revenue
Total Profit
Profit Margin %
On Time Delivery %
Late Delivery Rate
Average Delivery Delay
All KPIs were centrally managed in a dedicated measures table and formatted for executive consumption.

Dashboard Overview

The report presents a single executive overview page featuring:
KPI cards summarizing volume, value, margin, and service level
Revenue trend over time
On time delivery performance by shipping mode
Order distribution by delivery delay buckets
Service vs profit tradeoff analysis
Interactive slicers for date, market, customer segment, and shipping mode allow dynamic exploration. Tooltips enhance insights without cluttering the layout.


Key Insights

On time delivery performance is below optimal levels, indicating service risk
Majority of orders fall into short delay buckets, suggesting process inefficiencies rather than extreme failures
Faster shipping modes improve service but impact profitability
Delivery performance varies significantly by shipping mode and customer segment

Outcome
This project demonstrates end to end BI capability: data modeling, DAX driven KPIs, and executive focused dashboard design. The solution supports data driven decisions in supply chain and operations management.
